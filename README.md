# ArvatoMLproject
Udacity + Arvato Financial Solutions: Clustering customer segments and predicting high potential customers

## Project Overview
The project is divided into two main components. The first part is the customer segmentation and differentiating the customers demographics that are considered the core of the company. The second part is utilising the first part to be able to predict the customers that will most likely be customers for the company.
Machine learning will be used for the following underlying business matter: a client mail-order company trying to acquire more customers more efficiently.
Customer grouping will enable the companyâ€™s marketing team to decide: for which demographic part will the promotional campaign be most appropriate.

## Problem Statement
In this project, the problem is how the mail-order company acquires new customers more efficiently, given the German demographic data. This problem is divided into two tasks: customer segmentation using unsupervised learning techniques and the probability of being a new customer of the company using supervised learning.
The unsupervised learning methods on the customers data and their demographics will result in creating customer segments. 
After that we can train a model to predict the probability of a person in becoming a new customer (given a certain threshold) using supervised learning methods on another dataset.
